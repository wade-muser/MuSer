        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p><strong>MuSeR</strong> (Music Smart Enhancer) is a cross-platform application developed for music
            lovers that intend to have a centralized point of playlists management. The underlying mechanisms of
            the application are smartly interconnecting the entities (artists, songs, albums, playlists etc.) using the
            principles of semantic Web.</br>
            The main shining features of MuSeR are: easy interlinked search through artists, songs, albums, genres and playlists, lookup on different events related to the artists, create and manage playlists manually or generate "smart" playlists through a series of keywords and the existing created playlists.

        <section id="serverless-side">
            <h3>'serverless'-side</h3>

            <aside typeof="schema:WPSideBar">
                <center>The two main paradigms used in the design of MuSeR are 'serverless' and 'microservices'.
                </center>
            </aside>

            <p>
                <strong>'serverless'</strong> states that the functionalities of the application should not depend on any server entity and they should run unknowingly 'anywhere' (e.g. cloud). The Node module 'serverless' toolkit helps us describe and deploy the mechanisms of our application in the AWS Lambda, the cloud service used to 'host' the main workhorses.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Microservices</strong> architectural style represents a distinctive method of conceiving software systems. Each functionality or service is independent, deployable, small and modular, meaning that each one is as decoupled as possible from another. Combining this concept with the 'serverless' concept, each microservice in our application runs in a separate AWS Lambda unified by a central API Gateway. This one respects the REST API concepts and it will expose different paths for each microservice:
            <ul>
                <li><p><code>PlaylistService</code> - the main, most important service of MuSeR; it exposes the main creating, reading, updating and deleting playlists endpoints by using and aggregating results from other microservices</p></li>
                <li><p><code>ArtistService</code> - the service used to fetch information about artists, their records, biography and other details</p></li>
                <li><p><code>SongService</code> - the service that finds recordings and details about their creators and albums containing them</p></li>
                <li><p><code>AlbumService</code> - the service that searches collections created by artists and that contain songs</p></li>
                <li><p><code>GenreService</code> - the service that finds genres entities</p></li>
                <li><p><code>EventService</code> - the service used to discover nearby events related to music</p></li>
            </ul>
                <strong>An OpenAPI specification</strong> has been developed that describes the API paths and behaviour as you can see here:
                <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/WADE-Muser/muser/1.0.0">MuSeR Swaggerhub - OpenAPI</a>.
                Each microservice interrogates our MuSeR RDF repository - that was pre-populated with data from DBPedia and Spotify - to find information, entities and relationships between entities that will be later used to display smart connections or to create playlists.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Authentication</strong> component relies on the JSON Web Token technology that is used
                by an 'authorizer' represented by an AWS Lambda function. Each call of the REST API exposed by
                MuSeR requires the auth token and the access is forbidden if it is invalid or missing.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="client-side">
            <h3>Client-side</h3>

            <p>
                The <strong>User Interface</strong> of the application is created with the help of - maybe - the most popular cross-platform 'web-technologies' framework: Ionic, a fully fledged framework having Angular as the foundation client-side framework and Cordova as the main development environment which supports mobile devices and plugins for a whole suite of services and features.

            <h3>Design Details</h3>
            <h4>General considerations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Being a 'microservices-serverless-oriented' application, each functionality dwells into a AWS Lambda. Each of it will interrogate our central RDF MuSeR repository that holds data about all the entities and the relationships between them.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The user must register and generate a JWT before using the REST API exposed by MuSeR. Every subsequent call of the API will require the token.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The 'preferred' data transfer MIME type of MuSeR is <code>application/json</code> for the ease of use and the nice integration with Javascript and NodeJS.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Each instance's view for an entity type (e.g. an Artist or a Song) smartly  suggests other instances of the same entity type taking into consideration different aspects related to it: genre, time period, preferences etc.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Playlists can be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint providing a way of accessing the data from the RDF repository (GraphDB).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Main mechanisms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>'muser_populater'</b> is a complex mechanism created to receive a DBPedia resource entity (<i>e.g. dbr:Pink_Floyd</i>) and to populate the MuSeR RDF Repository with the most important data required by application's workflow; it fetches information about an artist, all the songs performed, all the albums released, all the genres related (and their derivatives) to the songs and albums; it also fetches the 'related artists' of the artist and reiterates over them
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The RDF repository was extended by using <b>Spotify</b> and <b>Songkick</b> services developed by us; Spotify populates further the entities by fetching the images and Spotify IDs (where possible) while Songkick is used to find events for specific artists
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Each microservice</b> has a set of SPARQL queries that were specifically written for each entity and use case; these queries are also used to fetch the results of an API call (e.g. <b>SongService</b> uses <i>find_songs_recommendations_type_album</i> to find songs similar to the one specified by taking into account songs from the same album and it is later used by the call of the endpoint <i>/songs/{id}/recommendations?type=album</i> )
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>The PlaylistService</b> exposes endpoints for creating, updating and deleting playlists. The "smart" playlists generation is a process that follows the "keyword artists" provided by the user and the songs from his personal playlists and suggest 15 random songs related to them (performed by "keyword artists" or by the artists of the songs contained by his playlists) 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>

                    </p>

            </ul>

            <p>
                The above shown sequence diagram presents the workflow of retrieving information about an artist. First, the authorizer validates the token received from the client and if the validation is successful, a lambda function will be triggered.

                Another sequence diagram shows the actions that are performed to generate a 'smart' playlist. First, a token validation is executed and if it is successful, the playlist generation is based series of keywords and the personal user data. Otherwise, if the token validation fails, the request will be denied.

                <p>The MuSeR's main storage is the RDF solution <strong>GraphDB</strong>. Every entity is saved in the graph (see the diagram above) by interconnecting the relationship with other entities and properties.</p>

                <p>In the tables below we describe each entities' properties.</p>

                <p>By using the ontology / RDF concepts, MuSeR is able to smartly suggest entities based on the relationships between instances. For example, upon creating a 'smart' playlist, the underlying mechanisms use other playlists created, stored and interlinked inside the RDF storage to suggest similar songs / artists, based on the keywords provided by the user and also on the personal user data.</p>

                <p>The entire ontology was 'packed' under the 'muser' vocabulary. In the following examples, everything without a prefix is assumed to be part of it.</p>

                As we can observe in the diagram shown above, all of the MuSeR's features require the authentication of the user. The user can visualize the already created playlists. During the visualization, users will be able to edit them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect of the application that can be observed in the diagram is the content finding mechanism. Users - for example - can find artists based on keywords specified by them. After finding the desired entity, he can select and add a specific song played by the respective artist into a personal playlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from this, the application will recommend other entities based on relationships of the visualized entity. (e.g. 'Songs from same artist', 'Songs from same Album' etc.)

            <h2>Conclusion & Future considerations</h2>
            <p>
                MuSeR has been created to ease up the management of playlists for music enthusiasts by providing an intuitive platform that uses semantic Web concepts to enhance the
                way of visualizing the relationships between various entities in the context of musical domain. The application can be extended and improved in different ways by conceiving new mechanisms and architectural ideas such as media streaming or machine-learning-related suggesting mechanisms.

                    All of these can be integrated in the current version of the design resulting in a modern, evolved MuSeR, an user-friendly playlist manager a.k.a music enhancer.
